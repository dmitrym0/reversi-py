Super simple Reversi (Othelo) clone in python. The "AI" is a basic MiniMax, by default it's set at 2 ply, which is 1 move look-ahead.

Run `./reversi-gui.py`. This should pretty much work out of the box on OS X 10.10. Your possible moves are indicated by squares that have stars. The stones with the red border have been flipped by the most recent move (both yours and computers).
